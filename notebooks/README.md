## 📁 About This Folder

This section of the [`SudoChem`](https://github.com/mridun-gupta/SudoChem) repo documents the **non-assignment Jupyter notebooks** — built during *Semester 2* under the *Engineering Applications of Digital Computers* course of the**Integrated Masters of Technology in Chemical Technology** program at **Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai – Marathwada Campus, Jalna (MarJ, in short)**.

These notebooks explore:

- 🧠 Python for engineering problems
- 🔢 Numerical solvers (ODEs, PDEs, nonlinear equations)
- 🖱️ GUI tools using `tkinter`
- 🧮 Functions, matrix math, visualization, and more

These aren't graded submissions — they’re **practice**, **experiments**, and **problem-solving playgrounds**.

> 📌 Assignment-related files are documented separately in [`Assignments/`](../Assignments/) folder.

## 🎓 Academic Portfolio Reflection

This folder represents a parallel track to my academic journey — not assignments, but **explorations**.

From building solvers like **Euler’s Method** and **Crank-Nicolson**, to crafting GUIs and learning numerical convergence hands-on — these notebooks reflect:

* 👨‍🔬 Curiosity-driven learning
* 📊 Comfort with visualization and numerical modeling
* ⚗️ Integration of chemical engineering problems into code

> These aren’t just notebooks. They’re milestones in a self-taught journey through the computational side of ChemEng.
