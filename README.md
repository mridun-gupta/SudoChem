# ⚗️ SudoChem — Experimental Code Lab for Chemical Engineering

> `sudo ./create --chem-reality.sh`
> A chaotic terminal where chemistry, creativity, and code collide.
> This is not coursework. This is curiosity, caffeinated.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

**SudoChem** is my **experimental repo** — the digital sandbox where I blend chemical engineering, computation, and curiosity.

While [`CollegeCodebase`](https://github.com/mridun-gupta/CollegeCodebase) is the structured, academic archive — this is the **after-hours lab**.
Expect creative hacks, original scripts, idea dumps, failed simulations, and maybe the next big thing.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Currently riding solo with:

- 🐍 **Python 3.x**
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
- 🔍 Explorations in chemical data, modeling, and logic

More stacks might sneak in soon, if the curriculum doesn’t rust *me* first.

> Think: “What if Antoine equation met GitHub Copilot?”

## 🧠 Why This Exists

To document the *thinking* behind the learning.
From **data-driven experimentation** to **weird one-off tools**, **SudoChem** is for every idea that didn’t fit the syllabus but made sense in the shower.

Here you'll find:

- 📐 Self-made tools for ChemEng problems
- 🧪 Concept demos & visualizations
- 🗃️ Failed code attempts that still teach something
- 🎨 Code for curiosity’s sake
